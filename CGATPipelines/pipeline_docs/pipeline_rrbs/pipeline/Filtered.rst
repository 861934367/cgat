Candidate Somatic SNP variants
=======================================

The following tables present candidate somatic SNP variants.

.. report:: Filtered.snp
   :render: table
   :groupby: track
   :force:

For definition of column headings see bottom of page. 

Candidate Somatic INDEL variants
=======================================

The following tables present candidate somatic INDEL variants.

.. report:: Filtered.indel
   :render: table
   :groupby: track
   :force:

For definition of column headings see bottom of page. 


Definition of column headings:
REF = reference allele
ALT = alternate allele
Normal_Ref = frequency of normal allele in control sample
Normal_Alt = frequency of alternative allele in control sample
Tumor_Ref = frequency of normal allele in tumor sample
Tumor_Alt = frequency of alternative allele in tumor sample
Impact = expected impact of variant
SNPEFF_GENE_BIOTYPE = if available, eg. protein-coding, pseudogene
AA_change = amino acid change
