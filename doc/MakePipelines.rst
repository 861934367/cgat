Lecgacy pipelines
=================

Within of the Ponting group we have developed a few other pipelines
that are based on the GNU ``make`` utility. These pipelines are listed
below:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   make_pipelines/CompareTranscripts.rst
   make_pipelines/Gpipe.rst
   make_pipelines/MapTranscripts454.rst
   make_pipelines/Optic.rst

Some of these pipelines are still being used, though they are not actively
supported any more.
