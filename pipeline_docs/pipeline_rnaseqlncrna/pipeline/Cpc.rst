Coding potential calculations
===============================

The coding potential calculator is run on a transcript level basis in order to identify
transcripts have potentail open reading frames. Filtering of coding transcripts is performed on
the level of the gene i.e if any transcript for a particular gene shows evidence for an ORF then
the all transcripts for that gene are filtered out.
