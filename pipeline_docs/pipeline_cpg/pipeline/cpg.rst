Binding Interval CpG Density
============================

The following plot shows the distribution of CpG density for each set.

.. report:: cpg.CpGDensity
   :render: box-plot
   :logscale: y

   Boxplot of the CpG density

.. report:: cpg.CpGDensity
   :render: line-plot
   :transform: histogram
   :groupby: all
   :as-lines:

   Distribution of CpG density


Binding Interval CpG Observed/Expected
======================================

The following plots show the distribution of observed/expected CpGs for each dataset.
The expected number of CpG dinucleotides was calculated as the length of the sequence divided by the number of 
possible dinucleotides as in Takai and Jones PNAS (2002). 
The control dataset was generated by taking an interval of the same size 10kb upstream of the CpG island.

.. report:: cpg.CpGObsExp1
   :render: box-plot
   :logscale: y

   Boxplot of observed/expected CpGs (expected = length/16)

.. report:: cpg.CpGObsExp1
   :render: line-plot
   :transform: histogram
   :groupby: all
   :as-lines:

   Distribution observed/expected CpGs (expected = length/16)


The following plots show the distribution of observed/expected CpGs for each set.
The expected number of CpG dinucleotides was calculated as the product of the number of C and G nucleotides 
in the interval divided by the interval length as in Emboss cpgplot.
The control dataset was generated by taking an interval of the same size 10kb upstream of the CpG island.

.. report:: cpg.CpGObsExp2
   :render: box-plot
   :logscale: y

   Boxplot of observed/expected CpGs (expected = nC*nG/length)

.. report:: cpg.CpGObsExp2
   :render: line-plot
   :transform: histogram
   :groupby: all
   :as-lines:

   Distribution observed/expected CpGs (expected = nC*nG/length)


Binding Interval GC Content
============================

The following plot shows the distribution of GC content for each set.

.. report:: cpg.GCContent
   :render: box-plot
   :logscale: y

   Boxplot of the GC content

.. report:: cpg.GCContent
   :render: line-plot
   :transform: histogram
