This sections lists binding intervals of interest.

Intervals by Fold Change
========================

.. report:: Intervals.IntervalListFoldChange
   :render: table
   :groupby: track

   Intervals sorted by fold change.
   The fold change is computed as the number
   of reads in the interval in the ChIP sample
   compared to the input sample.


Intervals by Maximum Coverage
=============================

.. report:: Intervals.IntervalListPeakval
   :render: table
   :groupby: track

   Intervals with largest maximum coverage in the ChIP sample
