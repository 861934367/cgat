================================
Long Interval CAPseq Profile
================================

Density of CAPseq reads over 500 genes with a minimum 1bp overlap with long (>2.5kb) CAPseq intervals. 
500 genes which overlap a CAPseq interval of average length were used for comparison. 
This method counts CAPseq reads overlapping exons only.
