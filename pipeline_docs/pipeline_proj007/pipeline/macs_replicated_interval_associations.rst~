==================================================================
Association of CAPseq intervals with Genes & Enhancers
==================================================================

CAPseq interval were annotated as within 5kb of a protein-coding or non-coding TSS or overlapping with a H3K4Me1 interval. 
Association was performed hierarchically as follows: coding TSS > noncoding TSS > enhancer
